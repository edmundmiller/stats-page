## GitHub organisation members

We use GitHub to manage all of the code written for nf-core. It's a fantastic platform and provides a huge number of tools. We have a GitHub organisation called nf-core which anyone can join: drop us a note here or anywhere and we'll send you an invite.

It's not required to be a member of the nf-core GitHub organisation to contribute. However, members get the nf-core logo listed on their profile page and full write-access to all nf-core repositories.

```github_members
select * from community_github_members;
```

## GitHub Contributors

Anybody can fork nf-core repositories and open a pull-request. Here we count how many different people have contributed at least one commit to an nf-core repository, or created or commented on an issue or pull-request.
