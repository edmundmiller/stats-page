Slack is a real-time messaging tool, with discussion split into channels and groups. We use it to provide help to people running nf-core pipelines, as well as discussing development ideas. You can join the nf-core slack by getting an invite [here](https://nf-co.re/join/slack).

```sql view_days
select
    to_timestamp(timestamp) as timestamp
from slack
group by timestamp
```

<DateRange
    name=range_filtering_a_query
    data={view_days}
    dates=timestamp
    defaultValue="All Time"
/>

```users_long_filtered
SELECT
    to_timestamp(timestamp) AS timestamp,
    inactive_users AS value,
    'inactive_users' AS category
