When people contribute code to a nf-core repository, we conduct a "Pull request" - other members of the nf-core community review the proposed code and make suggestions, before merging into the main repository.

<!-- TODO GitHub Pull Requests over time -->

## Pull Request response times

Pull-requests are reviewed by the nf-core community - they can contain discussion on the code and can be merged and closed. We aim to be prompt with reviews and merging. Note that some PRs can be a simple type and so very fast to merge, others can be major pipeline updates.
